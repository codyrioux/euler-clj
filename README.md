# euler-clj

A clojure repository containing my solutions to project euler problems.
This is primarily a testbed to help me get some experience using core.typed
as my daily research code doesnt' afford me a lot of extra time in
doing so. However I'll also be exploring other things here as time goes on,
I'll try to maintain a full list here:

- core.typed
- clojure.test
- simple-check

## Usage

Every namespace has a -main method which takes no parameters and executes
the eulerX function with the parameters specified in the project euler
problems
